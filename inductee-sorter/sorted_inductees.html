          Best known as the creator of *Peanuts*, Charles M. “Sparky” Schulz also nurtured a lifelong love for hockey. Growing up in Minnesota, he learned to skate on backyard rinks and frozen ponds, often using makeshift equipment and even enlisting his grandmother as a basement goalie. After moving to California, Schulz built the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in 1969, creating a new hub for hockey and skating in Santa Rosa.</p>

            <li>Over 150 *Peanuts* comic strips featured hockey</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Schulz used his art to celebrate and promote the game, turning beloved characters like Snoopy and Peppermint Patty into hockey icons. His Snoopy Tournament drew NHL alumni and international teams, helping to elevate senior hockey on a global scale. </p>

          <p><strong>Honors:</strong> Inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame (1993) and recipient of the Lester Patrick Award (1981) for service to hockey in the U.S.</p>

          <p><em>A LIFE ON ICE – A DEFENSIVE ANCHOR OF HIS ERA</em><br>
          Terrance Harper’s NHL career spanned 19 seasons from 1962 to 1981, during which he established himself as one of the league’s premier stay-at-home defensemen. Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Harper battled back from severe childhood burns to pursue hockey—a sport his doctors encouraged to rebuild his strength. He rose through local teams to eventually skate for five NHL franchises, including the Montreal Canadiens, with whom he won five Stanley Cups.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>NHL Debut: 1963 with Montreal Canadiens</li>
            <li>5× Stanley Cup Champion (1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1971)</li>
            <li>Captain of Los Angeles Kings and Detroit Red Wings</li>
            <li>Career: 35 goals, 221 assists, 1,362 penalty minutes, +169 +/-</li>
            <li>Altercation with Bob Pulford led to separate NHL penalty boxes</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Playing Style:</strong> A physical, crease-clearing defenseman revered by teammates and goaltenders. Though not a scorer, Harper’s leadership and grit were invaluable. The ‘Harper hat trick’—scoring three goals in a season—became his tongue-in-cheek hallmark.</p>

          <p><strong>Post-Playing Life:</strong> Served as assistant coach for the Colorado Rockies. Widowed after 60 years of marriage, he now lives in Folsom, California, close to his children and grandchildren. At 84, he still skates twice a week.</p>
