          Cape Breton, Nova Scotia → Boulder, Colorado</p>
          <p><em>A LIFE ON ICE – FROM THE MARITIMES TO THE MOUNTAINS</em><br>
          Fred Merchant’s hockey journey began in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where he laced up the skates at age 12. After playing junior and varsity hockey until age 21, life took Fred away from the rink for nearly five decades. Remarkably, he returned to the game at age 69 and hasn’t looked back. Now residing in Boulder, Colorado, he continues to lace up twice a week with the 50+ group in Superior, CO, and has played in many tournaments throughout the U.S. and Canada.</p>
